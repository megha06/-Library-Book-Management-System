# In this project, a Library Book Management System will be implemented with the front end GUI developed using Tkinter and the backend database implemented in SQLite. 
# It is a single window tkinter GUI application which will implement CRUD( create, read, update, delete) operations on a ‘books’ database, in SQLite. 
# The window will contain text widgets to accept / display book title, author, year of publication,ISBN (optional) and a large text area/ list box to display the records which match the search criteria.
